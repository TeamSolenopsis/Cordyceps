Algorithm 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Cordyceps controller implements a variant of the Pure Pursuit algorithm.
The Pure Pursuit algorithm is a path tracking algorithm used for robotics and autonomous navigation.
The algorithm determines the steering angle of the robot based on the current position relative to the desired path.
A lookahead distance is used to determine the point on the path that the robot should aim for.
