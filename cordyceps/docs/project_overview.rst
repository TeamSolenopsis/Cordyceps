Project Overview

Project description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The project is an aplied research project, which aims to develop a system capable of controlling a team of robots to perform a task. 
The system will be able to control the robots to form a virtual structure (VS) and transport a load from A to B. 
The aim of this project is to take an initial step into the realm of collaborative load transportation. 
Through research and experimentation, we will explore the most promising and feasible methods for creating virtual structure formations.

The project will involve the following key components:

    * Robot Hardware: Turtlebot3 burger and Turtlebot4 

    * Software Development

    * Integration and Testing

    * Scalability and Adaptability: Designing the system to be scalable and adaptable, allowing for the addition of bigger tasks and more robots.

Scope
^^^^^

It is outside of the scope of the project to:
    * Develop a commercially viable product
    * Achieve specific performance marks
    * Provide training to use the system
    * Transporting a load from A to B
    * Integrate the system in any standardised robotics environment (e.g. OpenRMF)
    * The simultaneous control of multiple VS
    * Request virtual structures with a different number of members than robots available in the scenario
    * Perform the demonstrations in any other environment than the accorded one
    * Implementing a system capable of dealing with non pre-mapped environments
    * Account for dynamic obstacles
    * Task management
